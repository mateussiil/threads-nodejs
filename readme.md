This repository brings some examples of how to work with *Threads in Node js*

Yep, that's exactly what you heard, threads and Node in the same sentence. :D


You can use threads experimentally from version 10.5.5 [here](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).

In the repositories I'm using some newer services like Promise.any(), so it's foreseeable that you will use v16.0.5 version of Node.
